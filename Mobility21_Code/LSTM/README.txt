*************************

covarianceMatrix_LSTM.py - Converts motion patterns from the Argo mixture models data files into a covariance matrix calculated for each pattern based on their corresponding frames.
- Applies vanilla LSTM to the covariance matrices and predicts the next steps in the covariance matrices based on input of the previous steps.

read_data.py
Reads motion patterns data from the Argo mixture models files.
